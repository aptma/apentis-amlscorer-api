# APENTIS API documentation

Welcome to the **APENTIS API** documentation.

This API enables external systems ‚Äî such as CRMs, onboarding tools, or custom platforms ‚Äî to securely integrate with the Apentis platform to manage KYC/AML-related data and documents.

The API is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Apentis backend, using secure authentication methods.

## üîê Authentication

All endpoints are protected by a Bearer token. Clients must pass the token in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
```

## üåç Environments

This API is available in two environments:

| Environment | Base URL                              | Description                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Production  | `https://api.apentis.com/v1.1`         | Live API connected to production   |
| Test        | `https://test-api.apentis.com/v1.1`    | Sandbox API for safe testing       |

You can use the test environment to integrate and validate your setup without affecting live data. Contact us to receive a test token.

## üîÅ API versioning

The APENTIS API follows a versioning scheme using path prefixes (e.g. `/v1.1/`) and semantic versioning in the documentation metadata.

- **Major versions** (e.g. `/v1.0/`, `/v2.0/`) are used when introducing breaking changes. These may include removing fields, renaming paths, or changing behavior in a non-backward-compatible way.
- **Minor versions** (e.g. `/v1.1/`, `/v1.2/`) are used when adding non-breaking changes like new endpoints, fields, or optional enhancements.
- The current version is accessible via: `https://api.apentis.eu/v1.1/...`

Clients should always specify the API version in their requests and monitor changelogs before upgrading to a new major version.
